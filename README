A microframework to create multi-threaded php applications

See example1.php to just create one subprocess
See example2.php to create subprocesses from subprocesses
See example3.php to call events from subprocess in parent process
See example4.php to use invokable classes instead of closures
See example5.php to use Houston in your existing application
See example6.php to return values from subprocess to mainprocess
See example7.php how to handle exceptions from subprocess in mainprocess
See example8.php how to submit params to subprocess
See example9.php how to implement your own process type (i.e. curl - so you could load different apis at the same time)

I'm currently working on lot of new features, see TODO what's planned
